# 🧠 DSA and Competitive Programming

Welcome to my personal repository where I regularly upload my solutions and notes from practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)**.  
This repo is meant to track my consistency, organize my solutions, and help others who may benefit from my approach.
